Special Agency
=============

Everybody is special and everyone is an agent.

There is even no other choice. One cannot refuse the fact that they are unlike anyone else – this is what's "special". One also cannot refuse the fact that they belong to the universe (or that it belongs to them) – this is the "agency". 

The role of the Special Agency is to act as an interface that offers additional choices not usually visible under the normal circumstances. 

It is an open source methodology that involves discipline, time management, organizational management as well as  various practices of mind expansion, such as polysingularity, network analysis, Systema, Noguchi taiso, intuitive approach and many more.

Special Agency attempts to affect both normality and the very notion of it.  

Every Special Agent acts within the frame which is constantly questioned, expanded, and morphed into poly-orthogonal shapes, which gain their own frequency, rhythmicality, physicality, emotional hues, and variable dynamics. In that Special Agent channels the very unique thing that is only him/her/its and nobody else’s – the natural lifeflow that was mysteriously obfuscated by one’s personality. 

It’s the remainings and artefacts of those obfuscations which are of interest to a Special Agent, as they are forming the building blocks and energy packets within physical matter – such as this book, the retina of the one who’s reading, the neuronal signal of the one who’s writing, the tremble within the air produced by somebody who speaks, sensations of somebody who touches.
